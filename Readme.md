Music boxes like google 
===========

![alt text](/images/music_boxes_jorge.jpg)

As a fan and user of Google products I was very fascinated with the "Google music" design. So I thought: "Hey! Why not to make a responsive design website similar to that and make it public for other developers?". For me, that idea was really cool so I started to work!.
 
I really love the result. Hope you like it!

### Features

- The project is an HTML5 + CSS3 responsive design layout.
- You can add more songs and boxes with different sizes quickly (just changing some tags on the design, very fast!).
- I added some cool animations using CSS3 when you mouse over on the images.

### Your feedback

If you have some ideas and feedback, please, open an issue or write me an email: <dividirporcero@gmail.com>. Would be awesome to hear your ideas ;).
