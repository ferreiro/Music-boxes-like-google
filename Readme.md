Music boxes like google 
===========

![alt text](/images/music_boxes_jorge.jpg)

As a fan and usr of Google products I was very fascinated with the Google music responsive layout. So I thought: "Hey! Why not to make the code and make it public for other developers.". As this idea was really cool for me, I started to work!. I use HTML5 with a responsive design.

I really love the result! Hope you like it!!
